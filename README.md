Web application that tracks and notifies users via email of price-changes in crypto assets
  - Modeled custom database schema and RESTful API with Active Record, Postgres, and Ruby on Rails
  - Integrated Resque and AWS Simple Email Service to dispatch price-change notifications to users based on alerts they create
  - Front-end built using React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, SCSS, and the browser Fetch API


## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v14 or higher), and npm
- Heroku CLI
- Postgresql

See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.


## Deploying

This application has all the starter code needed to help you deploy your
application to Heroku. It's recommended to deploy your project early and push up
changes often to ensure that your code works equally well in production and
development environments.

If you've already set up your environment to deploy to Heroku, you can run the
commands below to deploy your application. If not, make sure to check out the
Environment Setup section below.

To deploy, first log in to your Heroku account using the Heroku CLI:

```sh
heroku login
```

Create the new Heroku app:

```sh
heroku create my-app-name
```

Add the buildpacks for Heroku to build the React app on Node and run the Rails
app on Ruby:

```sh
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs --index 1
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby --index 2
```

To deploy, commit your code and push the changes to Heroku:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push heroku main
```

> Note: depending on your Git configuration, your default branch might be named
> `master` or `main`. You can verify which by running
> `git branch --show-current`. If it's `master`, you'll need to run
> `git push heroku master` instead.

Any time you have changes to deploy, just make sure your changes are committed
on the main branch of your repo, and push those changes to Heroku to deploy
them.

You can view your deployed app with:

```sh
heroku open
```

## Environment Setup

### Install the Latest Ruby Version

Verify which version of Ruby you're running by entering this in the terminal:

```sh
ruby -v
```

Make sure that the Ruby version you're running is listed in the [supported
runtimes][] by Heroku. At the time of writing, supported versions are 2.6.8,
2.7.4, or 3.0.2. Our recommendation is 2.7.4, but make sure to check the site
for the latest supported versions.

If it's not, you can use `rvm` to install a newer version of Ruby:

```sh
rvm install 2.7.4 --default
```

You should also install the latest versions of `bundler` and `rails`:

```sh
gem install bundler
gem install rails
```

[supported runtimes]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-support#supported-runtimes

### Install NodeJS

Verify you are running a recent version of Node with:

```sh
node -v
```

If your Node version is less than 14, update it with:

```sh
nvm install node
```

You can also update your npm version with:

```sh
npm i -g npm
```

### Sign Up for a [Heroku Account][heroku signup]

You can sign up at for a free account at
[https://signup.heroku.com/devcenter][heroku signup].

### Download the [Heroku CLI][heroku cli] Application

Download the Heroku CLI. For OSX users, you can use Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
```

For WSL users, run this command in the Ubuntu terminal:

```sh
curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh
```

If you run into issues installing, check out the [Heroku CLI][heroku cli]
downloads page for more options.

After downloading, you can login via the CLI in the terminal:

```sh
heroku login
```

This will open a browser window to log you into your Heroku account. After
logging in, close the browser window and return to the terminal. You can run
`heroku whoami` in the terminal to verify that you have logged in successfully.

### Install Postgresql

Heroku requires that you use PostgreSQL for your database instead of SQLite.
PostgreSQL (or just Postgres for short) is an advanced database management
system with more features than SQLite. If you don't already have it installed,
you'll need to set it up.

#### PostgreSQL Installation for WSL

To install Postgres for WSL, run the following commands from your Ubuntu terminal:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Then confirm that Postgres was installed successfully:

```sh
psql --version
```

Run this command to start the Postgres service:

```sh
sudo service postgresql start
```

Finally, you'll also need to create a database user so that you are able to
connect to the database from Rails. First, check what your operating system
username is:

```sh
whoami
```

If your username is "ian", for example, you'd need to create a Postgres user
with that same name. To do so, run this command to open the Postgres CLI:

```sh
sudo -u postgres -i
```

From the Postgres CLI, run this command (replacing "ian" with your username):

```sh
createuser -sr ian
```

Then enter `control + d` or type `logout` to exit.

[This guide][postgresql wsl] has more info on setting up Postgres on WSL if you
get stuck.

#### Postgresql Installation for OSX

To install Postgres for OSX, you can use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

Once Postgres has been installed, run this command to start the Postgres
service:

```sh
brew services start postgresql
```
